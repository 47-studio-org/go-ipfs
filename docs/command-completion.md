# Command Completion

Shell command completions can be generated by running one of the `ipfs commands completions`
sub-commands.

The simplest way to see it working is write the completions
to a file and then source it:

```bash
> ipfs commands completion bash > ipfs-completion.bash
> source ./ipfs-completion.bash
```

To install the completions permanently, they can be moved to
`/etc/bash_completion.d` or sourced from your `~/.bashrc` file.
